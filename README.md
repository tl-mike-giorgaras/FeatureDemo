# FeatureDemo
Demo of using Microsoft.FeatureManagement library. Used as aprt of a presentation for the dotnet guild. Showcases a few ways to use that library to enable feature flags and A/B testing.

# Next steps
- Build dynamic configuration into this so flags can be set/unset on the fly without redeploying/restarting your service.
